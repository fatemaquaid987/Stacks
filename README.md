# Stacks
A fun game of stacks made in Python.

## Overview
This is a simple game made using Python and Pyglet, a Python's library. The aim is to align bricks on top of each other such that no or minimum brick is cut-off from the sides. This game requires hand-eye coordination at its best to last longer in the game. The user has to be fast enough to make the incoming brick fall exactly on top of the stack.The higher the stack you built, the more points you earn. The player can select among the easy, medium and, hard levels.The player gets one point for every brick which stays on top of the stack, after it falls. The game will be over if the brick fails to land on the stack.
